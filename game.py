=========
This game comprises 2 players and consists in selecting tiles 
on the board (shown below).
Each player, assigned a symbol (nought("O") or cross("X")),
turn by turn, selects any available numbered tile on the board 
The aim is to the assigned symbol across a full row, column, 
or diagonal, before the other player does.
""")

    show_board()
    print("""
Example:
    - A win by player with symbol "X" could be across any row (or column diag):
   row: [1,2,3] --> ["X","X","X"]
    - A win by player with symbol "O" could be across any colum (or row, diag): 
    column: [2,5,8] --> ["O","O","O"]
[Note]: a game can have no wins where no symbol were attained across rows, cols, or diagonals by any player
 ==========
   
Ready to Start the Game?
You are assigned Player 1 with symbol ("X") playing against 
the computer Player 2, assigned the symbol("O").
